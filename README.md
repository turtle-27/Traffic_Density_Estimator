# Traffic_Density_Estimator:
    -Traffic Density Estimator estimates the static and dynamic traffic density of a given road with the help of the footage of traffic camera
    -In this project, implemented homography using OpenCV library in C++ for camera angle correction of video obtained from a real-time camera
    -Estimated the static and dynamic traffic density from the video using OpenCV Background subtractor
    -Employed multi-threading and sub-sampling using pthread library for an extensive runtime vs accuracy analysis

# Please open code, analysis, previous for more information
